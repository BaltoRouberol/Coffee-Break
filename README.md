<h3>Coffee Break</h3>

<p>Coffee Break is a small program designed to <b>help you to get back to work</b>, after taking a quick break from it.</p>

<p>Getting to work is hard. But getting back to it after an awesome TV series episodes (Farscaaaape for ever \o/), guitar playing or anything as cool as that, requires more than mental strength.. It requires someone to tell you to go back and struggle some more !</p>

<p>That is what Coffee Break does. It just reminds you after some time that you need to go back to work</p>

<p>Coffee Break has been developped and tested on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.<br/>
It requires the following python libraries: <ul>
<li>pygtk (v >= 2.0) <i>preinstalled</i></li>
<li>gtk <i>preinstalled</i></li>
